<p><i>Climb the World</i> is a free rock climbing application that uses OpenStreetMap data to display the location of individual rock climbing routes. The application has a built in climbing map viewer, climbing route editor, and an experimental Augmented-Reality viewer that will try to match the routes with the wall.</p>
